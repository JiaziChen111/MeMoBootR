# MeMoBootR

This package is in (super) active development. I am working on updating as I go through the different models involved in mediation and moderation. You can check out videos / updates on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMdihazndR0f9XBoSXWqnYg), as well as watching or starring the github repo.

To install the package take the following steps:

1) Install `devtools` if you do not have it. `devtools` is a package that allows you to install packages from github.
`install.packages("devtools")`

2) Install the `MeMoBootR` package by running the following:
`devtools::install_github("doomlab/MeMoBootR")`

3) Load the library to get started!
`library(MeMoBootR)`

4) Enjoy mediation and moderation complete with data screening. 

More tutorials, details, and other information added as I go. 

Many thanks to KD Valentine for the fantastic name suggestion.
